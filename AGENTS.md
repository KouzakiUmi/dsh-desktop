# DSH Desktop repository rules

This repository owns the desktop product around a pinned DeepSeek Harness checkout.

## Prerequisites and setup

- Use Node.js `^22.19.0` or `>=24.0.0` and the root Yarn `4.18.0` release through Corepack.
- Initialize the pinned upstream checkout with `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
- Install root dependencies with `corepack yarn install --immutable`.

## Build, run, and verify

- Start the desktop development workflow with `corepack yarn dev`.
- Build the desktop package with `corepack yarn build`.
- Root build, dev/start, and packaging commands refresh `dshmarket` from npm `latest` for the Next channel via `corepack yarn market:prepare`. Commit its exact dependency versions, Desktop compatibility patch, and lockfile together. `corepack yarn market:check` verifies freshness without writes; offline lookups or incompatible patches fail rather than silently retaining an old market. Installed apps do not hot-update executable plugins on launch.
- Before each release, run `corepack yarn aa:prepare-release` to build the latest official Agents Anywhere `main` for the Next channel. Commit the resulting artifact, provenance, manifests, and lockfile before packaging. The root Windows distribution commands verify freshness and installed versions; `DSH_AA_SOURCE_REF=pinned` is no longer supported.
- Run unit tests with `corepack yarn test`.
- Run type checking with `corepack yarn typecheck`.
- Run the complete headless gate with `corepack yarn check`.
- `corepack yarn dev:next` explicitly launches the Next app; `corepack yarn check:next` validates it without a graphical application. Next uses the official published Web frontend and the recorded upstream Desktop presentation, with product capabilities composed as a separate bundle.
- Next ships Windows x64 only. Its source, build scripts, packaging targets, interpreter payloads, icon resources and local dependency tree accept no other platform: keep `.yarnrc.yml` `supportedArchitectures` at `os: [win32]` and `cpu: [x64]`, keep `nextPackagingTarget`/`nextRuntimeTargets` failing loud off Windows x64, and do not reintroduce macOS or Linux packaging scripts, resources or tests. Shared helpers that take the platform as a parameter (for example the payload file policy) are not platform branches and stay as they are.
- Run upstream operations through the root scripts, such as `corepack yarn upstream:build`.

- `deepseek-harness/` is a pinned upstream Git submodule. Never edit files inside it from a desktop feature branch.
- `dsh-desktop-next/` owns the Desktop shell, Profiles and recovery, packaging, and adapters for the existing AA bridge and Community Market. It ships Windows x64 only. Its borrowed shared implementation lives in `dsh-desktop-next/adopted/` and carries no macOS or Linux entry point. Keep its upstream reference and published runtime versions aligned; do not fork the official main frontend.
- `dsh-community-fabric/` owns the community interoperability RFC. Until schemas and a reviewed reference adapter exist, it remains a private documentation scaffold and must not declare loadable DSH or package entry points.
- `dsh-community-market/` owns the community-market shell. Until its runtime is implemented, it remains a private documentation scaffold and must not declare loadable DSH or package entry points.
- The outer repository and all owned packages use the root Yarn release with `nodeLinker: node-modules`.
- The upstream submodule keeps its own pnpm workspace. Run upstream commands through the root `upstream:*` scripts, whose Yarn portable-shell commands enter the submodule before invoking Corepack.
- Compatibility mode must run the upstream default client without overrides. Advanced presentation belongs to desktop-owned client plugins and may replace documented slots or services through profile composition.
- Keep graphical application launch explicit. Builds, typechecks, unit tests, and Loader smokes must remain headless-safe.
- Commit before major changes of direction and keep the submodule pin update separate from desktop behavior changes.
- Keep the repository topology and package-manager split consistent with the [owning Agent Note](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-15-pinned-upstream-and-isolated-yarn-workspace.md).
